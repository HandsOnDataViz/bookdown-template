## Custom Blocks {- #custom-blocks}
NOTE: I commented-out custom blocks below and removed `index.Rmd` ref to `latex/preamble.tex` because it's not currently working as expected, so custom blocks do NOT appear in PDF output.

See Custom Blocks described in [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/custom-blocks.html) and [RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html) to setup style and output options. Be sure to add `echo=TRUE` in each instance because of the global `echo=false` in `index.Rmd` for all R code-chunk images.

Also add LaTeX code `preamble.tex` for PDF output, and include this in the `index.Rmd` PDF output, as described in [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/yaml-options.html) and [RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/latex-preamble.html).
