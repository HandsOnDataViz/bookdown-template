# Goals {#chapter}

Our broad goal is to create one efficient workflow to produce three versions of the book: HTML pages; PDF/MS Word; AsciiDoc.

1. As co-authors, we compose the book manuscript as individual R-flavored Markdown files (.Rmd), and use Bookdown to build as a set of HTML pages. We upload the files to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/handsondataviz) and publish open-access web edition at https://HandsOnDataViz.
2. We also use Bookdown to build the book as a PDF file and as a MS Word file, and upload these to the `docs` folder of our GitHub repository, which our editor may download to comment on the manuscript as we revise.
3. We also have the option to use Bookdown to build one large Markdown file (.md), and use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/try/) to convert it into one large AsciiDoc file (.asciidoc), for easier importing into the [O'Reilly Atlas platform](https://docs.atlas.oreilly.com/writing_in_asciidoc.html) if desired.
