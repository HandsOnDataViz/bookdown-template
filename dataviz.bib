Further, the spread of computers has made the production and dissemination of dubious statistics easier. While critics may agree on the desirability of increasing statistical literacy, it is unclear who might accept this responsibility.},

  abstract = {Unlike any time before in our lives, we have access to vast amounts of free information. With the right tools, we can start to make sense of all this data to see patterns and trends that would otherwise be invisible to us. By transforming numbers into graphical shapes, we allow readers to understand the stories those numbers hide. In this practical introduction to understanding and using information graphics, you’ll learn how to use data visualizations as tools to see beyond lists of numbers and variables and achieve new insights into the complex world around us. Regardless of the kind of data you’re working with–business, science, politics, sports, or even your own personal finances–this book will show you how to use statistical charts, maps, and explanation diagrams to spot the stories in the data and learn new things from it.   You’ll also get to peek into the creative process of some of the world’s most talented designers and visual journalists, including Condé Nast Traveler’s John Grimwade, National Geographic Magazine’s Fernando Baptista, The New York Times’ Steve Duenes, The Washington Post’s Hannah Fairfield, Hans Rosling of the Gapminder Foundation, Stanford’s Geoff McGhee, and European superstars Moritz Stefaner, Jan Willem Tulp, Stefanie Posavec, and Gregor Aisch. The book also includes a DVD-ROM containing over 90 minutes of video lessons that expand on core concepts explained within the book and includes even more inspirational information graphics from the world’s leading designers.  The first book to offer a broad, hands-on introduction to information graphics and visualization, The Functional Art reveals:  • Why data visualization should be thought of as “functional art” rather than fine art • How to use color, type, and other graphic tools to make your information graphics more effective, not just better looking  • The science of how our brains perceive and remember information ¿ • Best practices for creating interactive information graphics • A comprehensive look at the creative process behind successful information graphics ¿ • An extensive gallery of inspirational work from the world’s top designers and visual artists  On the DVD-ROM: In this introductory video course on information graphics, Alberto Cairo goes into greater detail with even more visual examples of how to create effective information graphics that function as practical tools for aiding perception. You’ll learn how to: incorporate basic design principles in your visualizations, create simple interfaces for interactive graphics, and choose the appropriate type of graphic forms for your data. Cairo also deconstructs successful information graphics from The New York Times and National Geographic magazine with sketches and images not shown in the book.All of Peachpit's eBooks contain the same content as the print edition. You will find a link in the last few pages of your eBook that directs you to the media files.  Helpful tips: If you are able to search the book, search for "Where are the lesson files?"  Go to the very last page of the book and scroll backwards. You will need a web-enabled device or computer in order to access the media files that accompany this ebook. Entering the URL supplied into a computer with web access will allow you to get to the files. Depending on your device, it is possible that your display settings will cut off part of the URL. To make sure this is not the case, try reducing your font size and turning your device to a landscape view. This should cause the full URL to appear.},

  abstract = {Most presentations of quantitative information are poorly designed—painfully so, often to the point of misinformation. This problem, however, is rarely noticed and even more rarely addressed. We use tables and graphs to communicate quantitative information: the critical numbers that measure the health, identify the opportunities, and forecast the future of our organizations. Even the best information is useless, however, if its story is poorly told. This problem exists because almost no one has ever been trained to design tables and graphs for effective and efficient communication. Show Me the Numbers: Designing Tables and Graphs to Enlighten is the most accessible, practical, and comprehensive guide to table and graph design available.  The second edition of Show Me the Numbers improves on the first by polishing the content throughout (including updated figures) and adding 91 more pages of content, including: 1) A new preface; 2) A new chapter entitled "Silly Graphs That Are Best Forsaken," which alerts readers to some of the current misuses of graphs such as donut charts, circle charts, unit charts, and funnel charts; 3) A new chapter about quantitative narrative entitled "Telling Compelling Stories with Numbers"; and 4) New appendices entitled "Constructing Table Lens Displays in Excel," "Constructing Box Plots in Excel," and "Useful Color Palettes."},

  abstract = {Enormous quantities of data go unused or underused today, simply because people can't visualize the quantities and relationships in it. Using a downloadable programming environment developed by the author, Visualizing Data demonstrates methods for representing data accurately on the Web and elsewhere, complete with user interaction, animation, and more. How do the 3.1 billion A, C, G and T letters of the human genome compare to those of a chimp or a mouse? What do the paths that millions of visitors take through a web site look like? With Visualizing Data, you learn how to answer complex questions like these with thoroughly interactive displays. We're not talking about cookie-cutter charts and graphs. This book teaches you how to design entire interfaces around large, complex data sets with the help of a powerful new design and prototyping tool called "Processing". Used by many researchers and companies to convey specific data in a clear and understandable manner, the Processing beta is available free. With this tool and Visualizing Data as a guide, you'll learn basic visualization principles, how to choose the right kind of display for your purposes, and how to provide interactive features that will bring users to your site over and over. This book teaches you: The seven stages of visualizing data -- acquire, parse, filter, mine, represent, refine, and interact How all data problems begin with a question and end with a narrative construct that provides a clear answer without extraneous details Several example projects with the code to make them work Positive and negative points of each representation discussed. The focus is on customization so that each one best suits what you want to convey about your data set  The book does not provide ready-made "visualizations" that can be plugged into any data set. Instead, with chapters divided by types of data rather than types of display, you'll learn how each visualization conveys the unique properties of the data it represents -- why the data was collected, what's interesting about it, and what stories it can tell. Visualizing Data teaches you how to answer questions, not simply display information.},

While still emerging, we are seeing evidence of the transformative potential of open data in shaping the future of our civic life, and the opportunity to use open data to reimagine the relationship between residents and government, especially at the local level. As we look ahead, what have we learned so far from open data in practice and how we can apply those lessons to realize a more promising future for America’s cities and communities?  Edited by Brett Goldstein, former Chief Data Officer for the City of Chicago, with Code for America, this book features essays from over twenty of the world’s leading experts in a first-of-its-kind instructive anthology about how open data is changing the face of our public institutions.   Contributors include:   Michael Flowers, Chief Analytics Officer, New York City Beth Blauer, former director of Maryland StateStat Jonathan Feldman, CIO, City of Asheville Tim O’Reilly, founder \& CEO, O’Reilly Media Eric Gordon, Director of Engagement Game Lab, Emerson College Beth Niblock, CIO, Louisville Metro Government Ryan \& Mike Alfred, Co-Founders, Brightscope Emer Coleman, former director of the London Datastore Mark Headd, Chief Data Officer, City of Philadelphia    “As an essential volume for anyone interested in the future of governance, urban policy, design, data-driven policymaking, journalism, or civic engagement, "Beyond Transparency" combines the inspirational glow and political grit of Profiles in Courage with the clarity of an engineer's calm explanation of how something technical actually works. Here are the detailed how-to stories of many members of the first generation of open government pioneers, written in a generous, accessible style; this compilation presents us with a great deal to admire, ample provocation, and wise guidance from a group of remarkable individuals.”  —Susan Crawford, author of Captive Audience   “Just as he did during his time in my administration, Goldstein has brought together industry leaders to discuss issues of relevance in the open data movement and the practical implications of implementing these policies… This book will help continue the work to make open government a reality across the country.”  — Mayor Rahm Emanuel, City of Chicago   “A must-read for anyone who is passionate about what open data can do to transform city living.”  — Boris Johnson, Mayor of London},

We make a general distinction between those methods and tools designed to help explore data sets and those designed to help present results to others. We argue that recent advances should be seen as part of a broader shift toward easier sharing of code and data both between researchers and with wider publics, and we encourage practitioners and publishers to work toward a higher and more consistent standard for the graphical display of sociological insights.},

While still emerging, we are seeing evidence of the transformative potential of open data in shaping the future of our civic life, and the opportunity to use open data to reimagine the relationship between residents and government, especially at the local level. As we look ahead, what have we learned so far from open data in practice and how we can apply those lessons to realize a more promising future for America’s cities and communities?  Edited by Brett Goldstein, former Chief Data Officer for the City of Chicago, with Code for America, this book features essays from over twenty of the world’s leading experts in a first-of-its-kind instructive anthology about how open data is changing the face of our public institutions.

  abstract = {Originally published to wide acclaim, this lively, cleverly illustrated essay on the use and abuse of maps teaches us how to evaluate maps critically and promotes a healthy skepticism about these easy-to-manipulate models of reality. Monmonier shows that, despite their immense value, maps lie. In fact, they must.  The second edition is updated with the addition of two new chapters, 10 color plates, and a new foreword by renowned geographer H. J. de Blij. One new chapter examines the role of national interest and cultural values in national mapping organizations, including the United States Geological Survey, while the other explores the new breed of multimedia, computer-based maps.  To show how maps distort, Monmonier introduces basic principles of mapmaking, gives entertaining examples of the misuse of maps in situations from zoning disputes to census reports, and covers all the typical kinds of distortions from deliberate oversimplifications to the misleading use of color.  "Professor Monmonier himself knows how to gain our attention; it is not in fact the lies in maps but their truth, if always approximate and incomplete, that he wants us to admire and use, even to draw for ourselves on the facile screen. His is an artful and funny book, which like any good map, packs plenty in little space."—Scientific American  "A useful guide to a subject most people probably take too much for granted. It shows how map makers translate abstract data into eye-catching cartograms, as they are called. It combats cartographic illiteracy. It fights cartophobia. It may even teach you to find your way. For that alone, it seems worthwhile."—Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, The New York Times  ". . . witty examination of how and why maps lie. [The book] conveys an important message about how statistics of any kind can be manipulated. But it also communicates much of the challenge, aesthetic appeal, and sheer fun of maps. Even those who hated geography in grammar school might well find a new enthusiasm for the subject after reading Monmonier's lively and surprising book."—Wilson Library Bulletin  "A reading of this book will leave you much better defended against cheap atlases, shoddy journalism, unscrupulous advertisers, predatory special-interest groups, and others who may use or abuse maps at your expense."—John Van Pelt, Christian Science Monitor  "Monmonier meets his goal admirably. . . . [His] book should be put on every map user's 'must read' list. It is informative and readable . . . a big step forward in helping us to understand how maps can mislead their readers."—Jeffrey S.

Second, respondents constructed ideal wealth distributions that were far more equitable than even their erroneously low estimates of the actual distribution.

  author = {Perlmann, Joel},
  date = {1987},
  journaltitle = {Sociology of Education},
  volume = {60},
  pages = {54--61},
  abstract = {Immigration and Social HistoryAuthor asks whether his study of blacks and immigrants in Providence, RI supports the findings of Lieberson, A Piece of the Pie, 1980. When the author wrote a 1986 article he studied Lieberson carefully but made only marginal reference to his important work. Author reviews Lieberson's major points on educational attainment from 20thC national census records on highest grade achieved: Native-born children of recent immigrants had similar rates of advancement to Northern-born blacks early in the century, but immigrant children pulled ahead sometime around 1925 to WWII. The 'cultural legacy of slavery' theory does not explain this evidence (since it happened later, not earlier), nor does Black family structure. However, the economic well-being of both groups as well as feedback mechanisms for blacks (the realization that schooling would not pay off as it had for whites) strongly affected educational attainments. Author reviews how his own work supports many of Lieberson's themes:  [author's sources: individual-level data on Providence students US census manuscript data from 1880 and 1900 combined with state census of 1915 and 1925, then matched with school records and occupational records.] On economic well-being: In comparing the odds of native and immigrant whites enrolling in school to blacks, controlling for family structure makes little difference but controlling for economic background among low manual skilled workers' families makes a substantial difference. "Blacks' rates of high school entry in this critical subgroup of the population were well within the range of whites' rates." p56, supporting Leiberson's pre-1925 claim that blacks once had a favorable position in education. On cultural differences: A comparison of the educational attainment of low-manual workers' Italian and Black sons of similar SES background shows that they had similar levels at the turn of the century, but the Italians later pulled ahead. "The black sons were muc less likely to have been involved in child labor, much more likely to enter high school, and received GPAs roughly comparable to those of the Italians. But when educational attainment is controlled, we find that the black men held jobs that were sharply less attractive than the jobs held by the Italians." 57 The contrast between occupational position and educational position confirms Lieberson's conclusions. [*Here I did not follow the argument - JD] The child labor data complicates the cultural legacy of slavery theory, however, because job discrimination against Black children cannot be distinguished statistically from families' desire to keep black children in school.  GPA data bypass the problem since they were not increased by job discrimination, and since black educational attainment was comparable to Italians' but their occupational attainment was lower, it would seem to refute the cultural legacy of slavery theory.  However, can any cultural theory be ruled out? "Cultural hypotheses can nearly always be reformulated in a way that fits the evidence, and in their form and uses they bear a discomforting relationship to biological arguments that should give anyone pause."58 One possible reformulation draws from Olneck and Lazerson 1980 and explains the black-Italian comparison by claiming that "...American schooling was not regarded highly by the first and second generations of Italians and that socioeconomic advances were made in jobs that did not require extended schooling."58 These Italians, it follows, perceived schooling to be central at a later point, but Blacks were affected by a cultural slavery legacy that affected both the educational and occupational spheres. Author does not claim that the above cultural explanation is superior to Lieberson's economic well-being explanation, but instead points out the difficulty of ruling out cultural explanations entirely. However, not ruling something out is very different from embracing it in support.  Author returns to Lieberson's brief and overlooked cultural explanation of feedback mechanisms on blacks in Northern social conditions (for example, how job discrimination could lead to reevaluating schooling as a means for getting ahead). Author states that Lieberson is ambiguous about whether feedback explanation means blacks acted accordingly with regard to education or whether job discrimination caused them to undervalue it. Author argues that readers should read Lieberson's words on cultural explanations carefully: he claims that cultural attributes from slavery were inconsequential in 20thC, but his brief mention of feedback mechanisms for Northern blacks did not render all cultural explanations inconsequential. [* I'm not sure what overall impression the author intended for the reader with this article. For me, it seemed to highlight the potential for  specific forms of cultural explanations in educational attainment studies, but it also left me wondering why examples of 'feedback mechanisms' were limited to blacks' Northern experiences with job discrimination. Why are there no other forms of cultural feedback, among immigrants or among Southern blacks, or in different spheres? The author certainly seems cautious about falling into a 'culture of poverty' explanation for 20thC black educational achievement, and his attempt to discuss cultural explanations in this context stuck me as unsuccessful and limited. -JD]},

  abstract = {Visualization is the graphic presentation of data -- portrayals meant to reveal complex information at a glance. Think of the familiar map of the New York City subway system, or a diagram of the human brain. Successful visualizations are beautiful not only for their aesthetic design, but also for elegant layers of detail that efficiently generate insight and new understanding. This book examines the methods of two dozen visualization experts who approach their projects from a variety of perspectives -- as artists, designers, commentators, scientists, analysts, statisticians, and more. Together they demonstrate how visualization can help us make sense of the world. Explore the importance of storytelling with a simple visualization exercise Learn how color conveys information that our brains recognize before we're fully aware of it Discover how the books we buy and the people we associate with reveal clues to our deeper selves Recognize a method to the madness of air travel with a visualization of civilian air traffic Find out how researchers investigate unknown phenomena, from initial sketches to published papers  Contributors include: Nick Bilton, Michael E.

Even when the statistical procedure and motives are correct, bad data can produce results that have no validity at all.

In this book, you will learn:  to choose the best chart that fits your data;   the most effective way to communicate with decision makers when you have five minutes of their time;   how to chart currency fluctuations that affect global business;   how to use color effectively;   how to make a graphic “colorful” even if only black and white are available. The book is organized in a series of mini-workshops backed up with illustrated examples, so not only will you learn what works and what doesn’t but also you can see the dos and don’ts for yourself.

Practical data design tips from a data visualization expert of the modern ageData doesn?t decrease; it is ever-increasing and can be overwhelming to organize in a way that makes sense to its intended audience. Wouldn?t it be wonderful if we could actually visualize data in such a way that we could maximize its potential and tell a story in a clear, concise manner?
