Preface
-------

This test book was last updated on 18 May 2020

Insert additional preface items below (acknowledgements, etc.) to ensure
that the first chapter is properly numbered as chapter one. If
subheaders are used, they will appear as separate HTML files, which is
fine.

Reminder: Bookdown does not auto-number figures in the `index.Rmd` file,
which serves as a ``preface'' file.

Goals
^^^^^

The broad goal is to create one efficient workflow for the authors to
produce three versions of the book: HTML pages; PDF/MS Word; AsciiDoc.

1.  Authors will compose chapters and sections of the book manuscript as
individual R-flavored Markdown files, and use Bookdown to build our
open-source web edition as a set of static HTML pages, one for each
chapter and each section. Readers of the web edition prefer shorter web
pages (one per book section) rather than longer ones (one per book
chapter).
2.  Also, authors will set Bookdown to build the book as one PDF file
and also one MS Word file, to allow the editor to easily comment on the
manuscript.
3.  Also, authors have the option to set Bookdown to build the book as
one large Markdown file, and use https://pandoc.org/try/[Pandoc] to
convert it into one large AsciiDoc file, to enable easier importing into
the https://docs.atlas.oreilly.com/writing_in_asciidoc.html[O’Reilly
Atlas platform].

Structure of the book files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have organized our http://github.com/handsondataviz/book[book
repository] as a set of individual files for each chapter and each
section. Chapter files are named 01-topic, 02-topic, etc., and section
files are named 01.1-subtopic, 01.2-subtopic, etc. As co-authors, this
structure gives us maximum flexibility as we create different pieces of
the book, since it allows us to add, remove, and edit different sections
of the same chapter at the same time.

Reminder: Our preferred file structure (multiple section files for each
chapter) works in Bookdown but produces this warning message, which we
ignore:
`You have 4 Rmd input file(s) but only 3 first-level heading(s). Did you forget first-level headings in certain Rmd files?`

* should we keep `number_sections: true` and use `{-}` after 3-hashtag
headers to avoid numbering those, or set to false and insert all numbers
manually?
* keep `chapter_name: "Chapter "` – or make blank and insert manually?

Style Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~

Header list (always insert blank line unless directly after hashtag
header)

* top-level chapter title (A) = 1 hashtag followed by `{#unique-name}`
* second-level section title (B) = 2 hashtags followed by
`{#unique-name}`
* third-level header (C) = 3 hashtags followed by `{-}` to avoid
numbering
* fourth-level header (D) = 4 hashtags followed by `{-}` to avoid
numbering

Each paragraph begins on a separate line. O’Reilly style guide prefers
_italics_ rather than bold. Use single back tics to display a monospaced
`code` word.

Insert an embedded link to https://www.oreilly.com/[O’Reilly]. This
appears as a colored clickable link in HTML and Word editions, and a
non-colored but clickable link in the PDF edition. According to O’Reilly
Atlas documentation, the AsciiDoc version should automatically unfurl
for the printed edition.

Insert three back tics to insert a code block. Check character line
length limits in
http://oreillymedia.github.io/production-resources/styleguide/#line-length[O’Reilly
style guide]:

....
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.6.0/dist/leaflet.css" />
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.6.0/dist/leaflet.js"></script>
....

Cross-references
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cross-reference strategies below require unique names to be assigned
to each chapter, section, figure, and table.

* All cross-refs are clickable and auto-numbered (except chapter) in
HTML.
* All (except chapter) are clickable and auto-numbered in PDF.
* All are auto-numbered (except chapter) in Word, but none are
clickable.
* TBA with AsciiDoc.

Demos:

* To another _chapter_ with HTML link: See link:chapter2.html[chapter
2].
* To another _section_ with Bookdown ID ref: See section 1.1.
* To figure in any chapter/section with Bookdown ID ref: Figure 2, or
Figure 3.
* To table in any chapter/section with Bookdown ID ref: Table 1.

Bookdown: If you want to cross-reference figures or tables generated
from a code chunk, please make sure the chunk label only contains
_alphanumeric_ characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), slashes (/), or dashes (-).

http://oreillymedia.github.io/production-resources/styleguide/#considering_electronic_formats[O’Reilly
Style Guide]: Using live cross references (e.g., ``see Figure 2-1'') is
best, but when that’s not possible, use ``preceding'' or ``following,''
as the physical placement of elements could be different in reflowable
formats. _Avoid_ using ``above'' or ``below.'' See also
http://oreillymedia.github.io/production-resources/styleguide/#cross_references

Conditional Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Conditional formatting offers the option to display text or images in
some editions, but not other editions.

Demo: Simple HTML code comment in .Rmd file (does _not_ appear in MS
Word or PDF or AsciiDoc):

The R package function `is_[html/latex]_output` allows authors to
produce conditional output for different book products, such as text
that should appear in the HTML edition but not the PDF edition, or vice
versa.

Demos:

This line appears in the HTML, Word, Markdown, and AsciiDoc versions,
and is commented-out in the PDF version.

Images
^^^^^^

TODO: Decide pros and cons of two methods, and probably use one method
consistently (unless there’s a strong reason for hybrid usage). Note
that auto-numbering may be a problem if we display different images for
HTML versus O’Reilly products

1.  Markdown formatting
* Simple syntax
* Converts easily with Pandoc into AsciiDoc format
* No auto-numbering in HTML or Word editions
* Auto-numbering in PDF edition
* TODO: Can this be compatible with R code-chunk conditional formatting
to make certain images appear only in HTML edition?
2.  R code-chunk formatting:
* More complex syntax
* Handles conditional formatting to insert iframe into HMTL edition and
static image for Word/PDF editions
* Image does _not_ convert to AsciiDoc format, but caption and static
number (Figure x) appears as placeholder.
* Figures are auto-numbered, but varies by format: Figure x.x in HTML,
PDF, but Figure x in Word; static Figure x in AsciiDoc.

auto-numbered reference in HMTL or Word, but auto-numbered as Figure x.x
in PDF. Note that image in PDF edition may ``float'' and appear before
after page, so PDF would need live cross-reference in text.]

Tables
^^^^^^

Create tables in Markdown format, since it produces good output for
HTML, PDF, Word, and Markdown. Use a tool such as
https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables[Tables Generator] to
import significant table data in CSV format, format the column alignment
as desired, and press Generate button to create table in Markdown
format. For significant table data, save the CSV version in a GitHub
repo for potential later use.

Add the Markdown table code shown below to auto-number (Table x) in
HTML, PDF, Word.

Workaround: Currently, our attempt to use Pandoc to directly convert a
Bookdown-generated Markdown file to AsciiDoc fails because Bookdown
creates the .md file with tables in .html format, not Markdown. One
workaround is to paste the individual Markdown-formatted tables directly
from the .Rmd into the large .md file prior to converting with Pandoc to
AsciiDoc.

Pandoc Conversion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* TODO: Ask Ilya about my Pandoc PATH and/or overwriting older version
* Set Bookdown to build the book as one large Markdown file (docs

* Use command line to navigate to subfolder with `pwd` and `cd`.
* Convert with:
`pandoc bookdown-testing.md --from markdown --to asciidoc --standalone --output bookdown-testing.asciidoc`
